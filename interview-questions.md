# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

`Your answer: `

Git is a control system that helps by keeping accountability of your projects and file in your machine. I would say that the main difference between Git and GitHub, would be that Git is based-off of your local machine, while GitHub is a web based service that allows users to share their code work as well as allowing them to be able to interact with others.The main difference between Git and GitHub is that git ison your local machine, and gitHub is to share and work on project with others and its based remotely.

`Researched answer:`

Git is a version control tool that is locally installed in your computer. Git is completly free of charge and is used by developers to track the history and changes on their work as well as allowing them to share it with others.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

`Your answer:`

The JavaScript operator that will retun a boolean value would be a ralational operator, logical operators will also sometimes return a boolean value.


`Researched answer:`

A relational operator , include ==,!=,<,>, >= and <=. In a relational operator, a relationship between the 2 values is what is being searched for. After a conclusion on the relationship has been define, a logical vector will be retun , which are either tru or false. True or false are both a boolean.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

`Your answer:`

 An index is the position/location of an element in arrays , and the positions of either numbers,letters etc. in a string. An index output will be a number starting with 0, indicating which for example "number in line" it has.
 The difference between an index and a value is that a value has the content of an element in an array , while the index is the location of that element in that array.

`Researched answer:`

An index starts at 0, and when refering to this it just simply wants the location of specific elements in an array. The count for the location of an element starts from 0 , with 0 being the index of the first element from left to right of the array.Values on the contrary,are the content inside the elements in an array. For example, in the array below, the indexx of the first element is 0, while the value is Nicole.

var names =["Nicole", "Natally","Valery"]

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

`Your answer: `

Similarities - String and array are similar in the sense that they both store data and both strings and arrays can be indexed and sliced. Both can be assigned to variables.

Difference - Array store collections of data that consist of the same data type, while strings is a sequence of text/numbers represented as a single data type.


`Researched answer:`
String and arrays are common in ways more than just one. For example,both strings and arrays are declared similarly, with char type being the only exception. Strings and arrays are also both used to store data.Strings and arrays are also similar in the sense that they both have a length property.
One of the main differences between an array and string is what they hold inside of them. For instance, arays hold a collections of elements that consist of the same data type. On the other hand, strings is a collection of characters wrapped within the quotations marks surrounding that single string. Another key difference, is that strings are immutable, which simply means that once the string object has been assigned, the value of that string annot be reassigned. Arrays are mutable, meaning that that they can be chaged or modified after they have been created ,depending on the developers needs.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

`Your answer: `
 
Pair programming is a great technique that allows for a higher level of concentration and a minimum amount of error by having multiple indivuals working from one machine. In this process, one person observes and provides the code, while the other executes the code that has been given. In proper pair progamming, the roles provided above will be switched frequently to provide good practice of both roles.

`Researched answer:`

Pair programing is a widely used technique were the key aspect is to the 2 or more people working from the same machine.the purpose behind this technique, is to be  abe to execute code more efficiently and with less error.

In this specific technique, we have 2 roles. One person is the "driver," and the other is the "navigator".The driver is in charge of the tactical aspect of project.They are the ones that will actively be typing the code,they will be the ones that will be thinking out loud on what is being typed, and they will be the one executing the commands that will be given by the navigator.On the other hand, the navigator check for accuracy on the code and give sproper input on the actions that are being put out by the driver. The navigator is essentially the one in charge of navigating the driver to the end of said project.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Functions that are within a funtion(taken as an argument), and gives another separate function

2. Jest: Allows testing of units in Javascript

3. Objects: Containers with properties and characteristics that allows for more organization.

4. Method: Actions that can be taken on objects to give function

5. Classes: Format the way an object should be created
