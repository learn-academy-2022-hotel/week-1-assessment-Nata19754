# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

`Your answer: `

Git is a control system that helps by keeping accountability of your projects and file in your machine. I would say that the main difference between Git and GitHub, would be that Git is based-off of your local machine, while GitHub is a web based service that allows users to share their code work as well as allowing them to be able to iinteract with others.

`Researched answer:`

Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

 Some core differences between Git and GitHub are that is a software, and GitHub is a SaaS offering (Software as a Service) that provides the Git version control software.Git is also entirely free, but GitHub is not. GitHub offers different plans from Free to Team and Enterprise

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

`Your answer:`

The JavaScript operator that will retun a boolean value would be a ralational operator, logical operators will also sometimes return a boolean value.


`Researched answer:`

Relational operators take two operands, compare their values, and return a Boolean value (true or false). They are typically used in conditional expressions to test whether a condition is true, or not.

In JavaScript, logical operators are used for boolean logic where a boolean value may be returned depending on the outcome of an expression. With the || (OR) operator, since values don't need to be explicitly true or false (they can be truthy or falsy), the operator can return non-boolean results when evaluated



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

`Your answer:`

 An index is the position/location of an element in arrays , and the positions of either numbers,letters etc. in a string. An index output will be a number starting with 0, indicating which for example "number in line" it has.
 The difference between an index and a value is that a value has the content of an element in an array , while the index is the location of that element in that array.

`Researched answer:`

The index property is a read-only property. It contains the position of a regular expression and was implemented in JavaScript 1.2. They indicate where in a certain javascript object a certain locaion or piece of indication is stored.

Index is used as a reference to the actual place holder in the element's value of an array.While a
Value is used to define what the actual variable type value is being held in the elements/indexes



4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

`Your answer: `

Similarities - String and array are similar in the sense that they both store data and both strings and arrays can be indexed and sliced. Both can be assigned to variables.

Difference - Array store collections of data that consist of the same data type, while strings is a sequence of text/numbers represented as a single data type.


`Researched answer:`

Strings are declared similarly as arrays with the exception of char type. String is a contiguous sequence of values with a common name. Unlike arrays, strings are immutable which means their values cannot be modified once they are assigned. The original content of the string cannot be changed once a value is allocated to the string.

One of the main differences between an array and string is how they are stored in memory. A contiguous memory block is allocated for an array meaning it represents a continuous block of memory. The elements of arrays are stored contiguously in increasing memory locations. Strings are stored like other types of arrays when they are declared as character arrays. A string class contains a pointer to some part of the heap memory where the actual contents of the string are stored in memory.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

`Your answer: `
 
Pair programming is a great technique that allows for a higher level of concentration and a minimum amount of error by having multiple indivuals working from one machine. In this process, one person observes and provides the code, while the other executes the code that has been given. In proper pair progamming, the roles provided above will be switched frequently to provide good practice of both roles.

`Researched answer:`

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together. The goal of agile software development is to deliver software on an ongoing basis so the results can be evaluated more easily.

In pair programming, one person is the "driver," and the other is the "navigator." The driver is the person at the keyboard who's actively writing code. The navigator observes, checks code for accuracy, and keeps an eye on the bigger picture.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Functions that are within a funtion(taken as an argument), and gives another separate function

2. Jest: Allows testing of units in Javascript

3. Objects: Containers with properties and characteristics that allows for more organization.

4. Method: Actions that can be taken on objects to give function

5. Classes: Format the way an object should be created
